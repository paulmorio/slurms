# slurms
Here are some slurm submission scripts I have used to simply run some scripts on the CSD3 HPC.

Currently available:
- CPU
	- Scripts which will complete under the maximum wall time
	- Scripts which use DMTCP to checkpoint at set times, and can resume from this checkpoint by calling the same script
- GPU
	- TODO

### Acknowledgements
Thank you to all the wonderful people at the CSD3 and the help I received from members of the lab.
